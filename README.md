# Facial Emotion Recognition

Recognizing facial expression of human is of significance in certain domains. Based on the expression of humans we can predict the type of content which affects a human and gain insights about their face expressions when exposed to a certain content. The human facial expression consists of seven states which are angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad and surprise. Each of these facial expressions have unique features and are important in classifying them.

## Usage
Code can be accessed through the provided Jupyter Notebook [file](https://github.com/faizan387/Facial-Emotion-Recognition/blob/master/Facial_Expression_Training.ipynb)

## Dependencies
* Keras
* OpenCV
* Matplotlibb
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* Pandas
* Seaborn

## Dataset
There are total of 35,887 samples of data and they are divided in 20% of testing and remaining 80% for training purposes.

## Prediction Results
it can be seen that the facial expression is classified as Neutral. The sample is from a video. The frame is taken at each second so the expression gets updated each second.
